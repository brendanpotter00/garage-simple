# Garage-Sale

I built a Full-Stack MERN Web Application, which implemented CRUD functionality, for Trinity students to list items to sell, such as mattress, textbooks, furniture, etc. 

This web app was made to solve the problem of texting in group chats or searching through cluttered websites to sell or buy college items,
especially after graduating, or finishing a class. In addition, this is a Trinity exclusive platform.

Used by at least 70 Trinity students and alumni and has hosted 100 unique listings and have fulfilled over 10 transactions.

Hosted using Heroku and Netlify.
